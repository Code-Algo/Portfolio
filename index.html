                <p>Fun Fact: This picture was taken by a friend in college. She had, without my knowledge, given me a high potency chocolate edible an 
                hour prior to this soup outing. I had never eaten an edible before. I didn't even smoke marijuana. Let's just say
                I did not finish the soup before what I can only describe as entering a manic state of panic and paranoia. The soup was good from what I remember, though.</p>

                <h1>The man behind the camera.</h1>
                <strong><small>Behind the sandwich.</small></strong>
                <p>Hi, i'm Alex. No, I am not a sandwich as my profile picture suggests. I'm the guy behind the camera, behind the sandwich. 
                I chose the sandwich as my profile picture because there should be a picture of me to your left eating soup (if I did this right), and
                I didn't want you, the viewer, to feel overwhelmed by my classically handsome good looks.</p>
                <p>To begin, I am a supporter of sarcasm. It is often my direct line of communication. I am a chef and owner of a restaurant called Algo Bueno here in Puerto Vallarta Mexico
                (you can check it out hitting the link at the top). My hobbies include playing guitar and writing. I would include cooking, but 
                I usually only cook at work. Hopefully I can start cooking for my own pleasure again after this course as I currently have no time,
                or a home kitchen as our home is being remodeled.</p>
                <p>As to why I want to become a programmer, I had actually entered college pursuing a software engineering degree.
                I was about done with all my prerequisites except for advanced mathematics. I had passed the pass/fail exam that
                was given mid-semester, but my finishing grade was a C. I had to achieve a B or higher to get into the software
                engineering major. So, I changed my major to English because I was pretty fed up with college and my experience and 
                just wanted to get my 4 years over with. I am a much different person now, and I feel as though i'm ready to finally
                pick up where I left off.
